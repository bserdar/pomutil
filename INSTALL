             POMUtils Installation

POMUtils is written in Java. You'll need Java JDK 1.6 and Apache Maven
(http://maven.apache.org/) to build it. Once you have the source, run

   mvn install 

from the source directory, and it will build everything you need. This
will build the following packages:

   target/pomutils-2.2.0-dist.tar.gz
   target/rpm/pomutils/RPMS/noarch/pomutils-2.2.0-1.noarch.rpm

You can either install the RPM package, or untar the tarball.

Installing the RPM package:

Run

   rpm -i pomutils-2.2.0-dist.tar.gz

It will install POMUtils under /usr/share/pomutils-2.2.0, and create a
symlink under /usr/bin to the pomutils and xmlfrag binaries.

Installing the tarball:

Run

   tar xfz pomutils-2.2.0-dist.tar.gz
